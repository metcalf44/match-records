link the players id to the result page - need to change the model to take over the player id.

link the goal/assists on the player table to the result pages so it updates each player

maybe add a played game section to the result page 

change scorer/assist function so that it reads n/a if no scorer or assists

sort out date layout

add error messages to form when info is not added
